# YoloV8
This repository contains the implementation of YOLOv8 for object detection and segmentation on images. YOLOv8 is a state-of-the-art real-time object detection system that is fast and accurate.This was a part of my practice on the model and along with the image, I used it on a video also, which can be provided on requests. Please feel free to contribute to my work and do give your feedbacks.
